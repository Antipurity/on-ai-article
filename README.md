# on-ai-article
A non-technical essay on AI and self-similarity. (If 'non-technical' means 'has no concrete code shown' (except when it does).)

Establishes first principles of existence (self-similarity of universal optimizers), and then clearly demonstrates how to properly create existence (like AI).

Many times, to drive the point home. A rich narrative.

Using a minimal number of words, more or less.
