# On AI
Establishes first principles of existence (self-similarity of universal optimizers), and from them, clearly demonstrates how to create existence (like an AI, on top of a universally-optimizing functionality network). No misconceptions.

Over and over, to drive the point home: a rich narrative.

Using a minimal number of words, more or less.

The main content is the content of index.html.

# HTML data URL

To open the HTML file without creating a file locally, use this in a Web Console:

document.write( (a=>'data:text/html,'+encodeURIComponent(a.raw[0]))`` )

(with file's contents pasted into ``) and copy (by triple-clicking) and open the data URL.

Much more convenient.
